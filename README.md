# üß† Print AI Assessment

AI Agent capable of finding information about books using advanced web scraping techniques and retrieving real-time trending headlines or news using Selenium from sources like Hacker News. It features a minimalistic and comfortable user interface for interacting with the agent.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Book Search:** Find information about books using various criteria.
* **Real-time News/Trends:** Get the latest headlines from sources like Hacker News.
* **Minimalistic Chat Interface:** Easy-to-use interface for interacting with the AI agent.

## üíª Technologic Stack

This project utilizes a modern technology stack to deliver a robust and efficient AI agent:

* **Data:** Redis - Used as a high-performance in-memory data structure store, used here for caching or storing retrieved information.
* **Backend:** FastAPI - A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
  * Selenium: Used for automating web browsers to perform web scraping tasks.
  * Requests: A simple, yet elegant HTTP library for Python.
  * N8N: Workflow automation tool used for handling webhooks and potentially orchestrating data flow.
* **Frontend:** React w/ Vite + Axios - A fast and efficient frontend development setup using React with Vite as a build tool and Axios for making HTTP requests.
* **DevOps:** Docker - Used for containerizing the application and its dependencies, ensuring consistent environments and simplifying deployment.

## üöÄ Setup instructions

To get the project up and running, follow these steps:

### Environment vars

* General:

```env
REDIS_HOST = redis
REDIS_PORT = 6379

N8N_BASIC_AUTH_ACTIVE = true
N8N_BASIC_AUTH_USER = admin
N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD = admin
N8N_HOST = n8n
N8N_HOST_EXTERNAL = localhost
N8N_PORT_EXTERNAL = 5678
N8N_PORT = 5678
N8N_SECURE_COOKIE = false

REMOTE_DRIVER_URL=http://selenium:4444/wd/hub
```

* Backend:

```env
REDIS_HOST = 127.0.0.1
REDIS_PORT = 6379
```

* Frontend

```env
VITE_N8N_WEBHOOK_URL=http://route-to-n8n-webhook
```

### Start the project

Once the environment variables are set, you can start the project using Docker Compose:
